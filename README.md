# Flutter Clean MVVM Architecture

This repository contains a Flutter project implementing the Clean MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. Clean MVVM is a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components - Model, View, and ViewModel - to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability of code.

# Architecture Overview

The Clean MVVM architecture used in this project is structured as follows:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.

View: Represents the user interface (UI) of the application.

ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View, handling the presentation logic and interaction with the Model.
